# Rossman Sales Prediction
> Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. For each store, the sales forecasting is taken care of by the store managers. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied. To overcome this problem, we will be building a forecasting model to forecast the daily sales for any store for the next six weeks.

## General Information
- Rossmann is a European drug distributor which operates over 3,000 drug stores across seven European countries. Since a lot of drugs come with a short shelf life, that is, they do not have a long expiry date, it becomes imperative for Rossmann to accurately forecast sales at their individual stores. Currently, the forecasting is taken care of by the store managers who are tasked with forecasting daily sales for the next six weeks. 
- Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotional campaigns, competition, state holidays, seasonality, and locality.
- With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances and intuitions, the accuracy of the forecasts is quite varied.
- To overcome this problem, as a data scientist, out job is to build a forecasting model to forecast the daily sales for the next six weeks.


## Conclusions
- Most important variables that govern the sale for store are:
	* number of customers
	* Promo
	* School holiday
	* Day of week
